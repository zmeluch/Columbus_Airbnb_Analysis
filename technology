# Technologies Used
 
## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Excel and Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.
 
## Database Storage

PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will use Tableau to display the data.
 
## Machine Learning
 
We will be using unsupervised learning for machine learning. Pandas were used to create and trim the data. Plotly is used to display the data while scitkit-learn is the ML library to cluster, scale, and principal component analysis.
