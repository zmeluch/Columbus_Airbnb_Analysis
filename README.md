## Proposed Data Sets

The proposed goal of this project is to drift whether AirBnB properties are clustered in areas where home baskets have increased.  This could indicate that these properties could be crowding out the availability of homes for individuals to purchase.  

The "base" data set is a listing of AirBnB properties in Columbus, Ohio.  Since this class is being offered by the Ohio State Universitt, it made sense to use data from the university's backyard.  Further, housing conditions in Columbus have been similar to other cities in the United States over the past few years.  

Housing characteristics from the U.S. Census Bureau will be overlaid on the AirBnB listings.  This will facilitate the analysis of housing characteristics within the city.  

These proposed data sets are described in more details below:
