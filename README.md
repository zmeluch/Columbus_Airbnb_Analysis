# Triangle Role

## Background
The purpose of our analysis and Machine Learning model is to find how the density of AirBnbs in a given area affect the pricing of single family houses in that area. The dataset used contains the airbnb listings in Columbus, Ohio in 2015 as well as 2020, along with various measures of the cities' housing economy such as the median home value and median household income in Columbus for both 2015 and 2020.

## Our Machine Learning Model

After trimming unneeded columns and converting all objects and strings to floats, the data is ready to be manipulated.

Next, a basic scatterplot displaying the median household value in Columbus in 2015 vs 2020 arranged into three classes was created.

A three dimensional model was then created to display the median household value in both 2015 and 2020 along with the number of occupied Airbnb units in year 2020, again arranged into three classes.
