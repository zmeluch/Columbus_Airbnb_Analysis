Team Members: Zach, Kelley, Michael, Autumn

Topic: How are Airbnb's affecting the housing market and values in the Columbus OH area?

We selected this topic for a few reasons. Kelley works with housing and properties in her current job. Michael's sister owned a couple of properties that she ran as Airbnb's but the neighbors became alienated so she is looking to sell the properties. Zach had seen Airbnb's and housing market as a hot topic on social media. Autumn's neighbors were upset about local property being used as Airbnb but all had used the service themselves. All of us have stayed at Airbnb's.

We used 3 primary data sources 2015 and 2020 Census Data and Airbnb data for Columbus OH.

We are still defining the questions we are hoping to answer but preliminary list is below.

    1.	Did house values change from 2015 to 2020 where there were large concentrations of Airbnb's?
    
    2.	Did some house value ranges see more listings as Airbnb's?
    
    3.	Were there other variables in Airbnb clusters?
    
    4.	Did median family income increase due to Airbnb?
